Need to decide on stats needed for each position/team.

Given what stats we need for player, SQL query

year > season > week, group stats by players, 

SELECT ( player_id, week, SUM(foo), ... )
FROM game 
JOIN play_player
ON game.gsis_id = play_player.gsis_id
WHERE game.season_year = 
  AND game.season_type =
  AND game.finished    = TRUE
GROUP BY player_id;  


ex
SELECT play_player.player_id, game.week, SUM(play_player.passing_yds)
FROM game
JOIN play_player
ON game.gsis_id = play_player.gsis_id
WHERE game.season_year = 2013
  AND game.season_type = 'Regular'
  AND game.finished    = TRUE
  AND play_player.passing_yds > 0
GROUP BY play_player.player_id, game.week ORDER BY play_player.player_id, game.week
